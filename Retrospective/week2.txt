Retrospective for week 2:
What is going well so far is our communication and meeting times. As a group we have been able to meet multiple times in a sprint week to have discussions about how to design the code we are going to write. Whats not going so well is the completion of all the documentation associated with this project. We missed multiple sections of the rubric by simply just not paying close enough attention to detail. In the coming week we are going to read over the rubric before submitting and in our meetings remind each other about the details associated with group projects.
